# NoteHero
A complete, release-ready app for storing notes loosely based on the OnePlus stock Notes app and Google Keep. It's the source code for this blog post (tentative link here) which demonstrates a simplistic, easy-to-understand approach on how to build a professional, release-ready android app from the ground up using modern Android App development techniques.

## Features

The app has three screens, namely:  and it provides the following functionalities

### Functionalities

- Multi-colored theming with Light/Dark options for better readability.
- Control a Note's accessibility with a password-protected vault feature. 

### Components/Techniques/Methodologies demonstrated

It demonstrates the use of modern Android app development techniques/frameworks such as the MVVM + LiveData from Android architecture components within a Single-Activity model.
It highlights standard android programming frameworks and how they should be used such as the new Architecture components and the Material components. 
It also talks about creating user-interfaces that does not hamper performance. It also uses proguard for code shrinking and obfuscation.

### Deployment

You can open the project in Android studio, press run and build it on a mobile device or the emulator.

### Testing

The app is composed of unit and UI tests...

### Libraries 

* [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) for dependency injection
* [Kotlin Coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines-overview.html) for asynchronous programming.
* See [This](https://github.com/googlesamples/android-architecture-components/tree/master/GithubBrowserSample) for further inspiration.
