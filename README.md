# NoteHero
A complete, release-ready app for storing notes loosely based on the OnePlus stock Notes and Google Keep app design. It's the source code for this blog post (tentative link here) which demonstrates a simplistic, easy-to-understand approach on how to build a professional, release-ready android app from the ground up using modern Android App development techniques.

## Features

The app has three screens, namely:  and it provides the following functionalities

### Functionalities

- Multi-colored theming with Light/Dark options for better readability.
- Control a Note's accessibility with a password-protected vault feature. 

### Components/Techniques/Methodologies demonstrated

It demonstrates the use of modern Android app development techniques/frameworks such as the MVVM + LiveData from Android architecture components.
It highlights standard android programming frameworks and how they should be used such as the new Architecture components and the Material components. 
It also talks about creating user-interfaces that does not hamper performance. It also uses proguard for code shrinking and obfuscation.

### Deployment

You can open the project in Android studio, press run and build it on a mobile device or the emulator.

### Testing

The app is composed of unit and UI tests...

### Libraries 

* [Dagger2](https://google.github.io/dagger/) for dependency injection
